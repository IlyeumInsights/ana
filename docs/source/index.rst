ANA: an AutoML-Based Negotiation Assistant
=============================================

ANA (standing for *Automl-based Negotiation Assistant*) is an assitance tool
for contract-based negotiation processes.
Through provided annotated examples of rejected/accepted clauses
(usually obtainable through tracks of previous negotiations) and acceptance 
policies, ANA is able to learn to identify unacceptable clauses and to point out
violted policies.
Thanks to its composite AutoML approach, ANA adapts to any domain and 
type of contracts.

ANA is presented in the paper: *Toward a Generic AutoML-Based 
Assistant for Contracts Negotiation*, to appear in ECAI 2020 proceedings.

.. note::
    ANA is currently is currently at the stage of "experimental prototyping". 
    Features are being added to make it a functionnal prototype.

---------------

.. function:: normalizeText(text)

   normalizeText

   Normalizes raw text by removing accents and special characters, lowering the
   text and removing trailing spaces.

   :param text: Text to normalize.
   :type text: str

   :return: Normalized text.
   :rtype: str


.. function:: mergeTextLines(text)

   mergeTextLines

   Remove line breaks.

   :param text: Text with line breaks.
   :type text: str

   :return: Text without line breaks.
   :rtype: str


.. function:: clean(text)

   clean

   Performs the actual cleaning: normalize, merge lines and filter short words.

   :param text: Text to clean.
   :type text: str

   :return: Clean text.
   :rtype: str


.. function:: filterWords(tokens, threshold=3, numbers=True)

   filterWords

   Remove short (size <= threshold) words that are irrelevant in analysis.
   Numbers be ignored by the filter.

   :param tokens: List of words.
   :type tokens: list(str)

   :param threshold: Words shorter than the threshold are to be filtered.
   :type threshold: int

   :param numbers: Assert if numbers should be filtered. (True if numbers are
   not filtered). True by default.
   :type numbers: int

   :return: Filtered list of words.
   :rtype: list(str)


.. function:: filterText(text, threshold=3, numbers=True)

   filterText

   Remove short (size <= threshold) words that are irrelevant in analysis.
   Numbers be ignored by the filter.
   Performs this task by decomposing the text as a list of words and calling
   'filterWords'.

   :param text: Text to filter.
   :type text: str

   :param threshold: Words shorter than the threshold are to be filtered.
   :type threshold: int

   :param numbers: Assert if numbers should be filtered. (True if numbers are
   not filtered). True by default.
   :type numbers: int

   :return: Filtered text.
   :rtype: str

   module TextGeneticOversampler

   Provide a class that enrich a text dataset by exchanging parts between two
   texts, as perform in chromosomes before mitosis.

.. py:class:: TextGeneticOversampler(generation=1)

   class TextGeneticOversampler

   Oversamples text samples by generating new sentences by genetic-like merge.

   :param generation: Number of exchange process to apply.
   :type generation: int

   .. attribute:: generation
      :annotation: = 1

      

   .. method:: packText(self, text, nbPack)


      packText

      Transforms a text as a set of pack of words.
      By default, create packs containing one word each.
      Packs the granule that are used to create further sentences.

      :param text: Text to decompose as a set of pack.
      :type text: str
      :param nbPack: Number of expected packs.
      :type nbPack: int
      :return: A set of pack of words.
      :rtype: list(list(str))


   .. method:: geneticTextMerge(self, textA, textB, ordered=False, nbPack=0, mutaRate=0.25)


      geneticTextMerge

      Exchanges packs (subtext) of two sentences/texts, thus generating
      variation of both texts.

      :param textA: First text.
      :type textA: str
      :param textB: Second text.
      :type textB: str
      :param ordered: assert if pack/word should be kept in initial order,
      defaults to False
      :type ordered: bool, optional
      :param nbPack:  number of text parts that will be exchanged,
      defaults to 0
      :type nbPack: int, optional
      :param mutaRate: Mutation rate that represents the rate of exchanged
      parts in the texts, defaults to 0.25
      :type mutaRate: float, optional
      :return: First mutated text.
      :rtype: str
      :return: Second mutated text.
      :rtype: str


   .. method:: fit_resample(self, X, Y)


      fit_resample

      Performs the actual overfitting by generating new samples/sentences by
      by genetic combination per class.

      :param X: Text samples.
      :type X: np.array
      :param Y: Annotation for each text of X
      :type Y: np.array
      :return: Oversampled text samples set.
      :rtype: np.array
      :return: Oversampled text annotation.
      :rtype: np.array



.. data:: sentA
   :annotation: = Ceci est une phrase tr√®s jolie.
